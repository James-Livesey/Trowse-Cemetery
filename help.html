            <p>
                Welcome to Trowse Cemetery's plot databasing and mapping
                system! This system provides you with an easy way to manage
                plots and display them on a map. Seamlessly add and remove
                plots, manage occupants, and easily find anything using the
                search function.
            </p>
            <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <p>
                Getting started is easy on this system â”€ if you haven't
                already, press the <strong>Sign in</strong> button in the
                top-right hand corner. If you've got an account with this
                system, simply enter your email address and password. If you
                don't, press <strong>Sign up</strong>, then enter your full
                name, email address and password.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, editing for your account will be disabled until a
                trusted user enables editing on your account for you. You can
                check if you are allowed to edit the database by going to the
                <strong>Data</strong> tab and seeing if you can edit the
                database without any errors. If you can't, you'll need to
                contact a user who already has edit permissions to add you to
                the whitelist of users who are allowed to edit.
            </p>
            <h2>Allowing someone else to edit</h2>
            <p>
                If you are a user who is allowed to edit the database, sign in
                (if you haven't done already), then press on your name in the
                top-right hand corner, followed by the
                <strong>Settings</strong> button. This will show the settings
                for your account.
            </p>
            <p>
                To allow the user to edit, find their name and email address
                within the <strong>User account permissions</strong> section of
                Settings. When you're absolutely certain that you can trust the
                user with editing permissions, toggle the switch to the on
                position by their name in the <strong>Can edit?</strong> field.
            </p>
            <h3>Revoking permissions</h3>
            <p>
                If you feel that a user cannot be trusted, you can disable
                their editing permission by toggling the same switch to the off
                position. They will no longer be able to edit the plot
                database, or even change permissions of other users.
            </p>
            <h2>Managing your account</h2>
            <p>

                <strong>Settings</strong> button. This will show the settings
                for your account.

                <strong>Full name</strong> input, then press the
                <strong>Save</strong> button.
            </p>
            <p>
                To change the email address that you use to sign in with, press
                the <strong>Change email</strong> button, then enter your
                current email address and password (for security reasons), then
                enter your new email address and press the
                <strong>Save</strong> button.

                account</strong> button, then enter your current email address
                and password (for security reasons), then press the
                <strong>Delete</strong> button. This will delete your account
                and the data associated with it will not be recovered. Please
                note that the plot database will not be deleted.
